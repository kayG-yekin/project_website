                    Education system has been playing a significant role in the life of every
                    young boys and girls of Bhutan.
                    Parents these days urges their children to
                    get enroll in schools whereby there is number of students every year. Due to this reason it is very
                    difficult and requires longer duration in processing the details of students. There is no such
                    proper platform in Bhutan that provides an ample of information related to students. For an example,
                    the Bhutan Council for school examinations and
                    assessment (BCSEA) announces the result of Bhutan higher secondary education certificate (BHSEC-XII)
                    every year but BCSEA provides only the specific and limited information to the society. BCSEA
                    provides information like overall pass percentage of class 12 and performance ranking of the
                    students but the details such as the subject topper, total passed students from each school, average
                    performance level of every school and performance comparison between boys and girls are left out.
                    Therefore, this project aims to analysis the result of class 12 science result and predict the class
                    12 science results of coming year in order to provide a satisfactory information to the communities
                    of Bhutan.

            <h2>Techniques used in ML model</h2>
            <p>Machine Learning Techniques (like Regression, Classification, Clustering, Anomaly detection, etc.) are
                used to build the training data or a mathematical model using certain algorithms based upon the
                computations statistic to make prediction without the need of programming, as these techniques are
                influential in making the system futuristic, models and promotes automation of things with reduced cost

                <p>
                    Linear regression is one of the easiest and most popular Machine Learning algorithms. It is a
                    statistical method
                    that is used for predictive analysis. Linear regression makes predictions for continuous/real or
                    numeric variables
                    such as sales, salary, age, product price, etc. Linear regression algorithm shows a linear
                    relationship between
                    a dependent (y) and one or more independent (y) variables, hence called as linear regression.

                    Decision tree learning or induction of decision trees is one of the predictive modelling approaches
                    used in statistics,
                    data mining and machine learning. It uses a decision tree (as a predictive model) to go from
                    observations about
                    an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in
                    the leaves).

                <p>
                    A Naive Bayes Classifier is a supervised algorithm in machine-learning which uses the Bayes Theorem.
                    The theorem depends on the assumption that input variables are independent
                    of each other. Irrespective of this assumption, it has proven to be a classifier with better
                    results.

                <font> Logistic Regression</font>
                <p>
                    Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable. Therefore the outcome
                    must be a
                    categorical or discrete value. It can be either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or False, etc. but instead
                    of giving the exact value as 0 and 1, it gives the probabilistic values which lie between 0 and 1.
                    Logistic Regression is much similar to the Linear Regression except that how they are used. Linear
                    Regression is used for solving Regression problems, whereas Logistic regression is used for solving
                    the classification problems.
